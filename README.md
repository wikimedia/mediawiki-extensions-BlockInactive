# BlockInactive

The extension is intended to help wiki administrators to keep track of
inactive users, send warning emails to such users and then automatically
block their account if no action were taken in time.

It's possible to configure number of days since last login to be considered
as inactivity, number of days since last login to actually block a user account
and setup a schedule for warning messages to be sent prior to blocking.
